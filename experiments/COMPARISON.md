# Task 22168020: Three Architecture Comparison

## Task Description
**Pattern**: Fill horizontal gaps on each row for each colored object
- Input: Sparse colored cells on each row
- Output: Fill all columns between leftmost and rightmost cell of each color on each row

## Results Summary

| Approach | Train 0 | Train 1 | Train 2 | Test 0 | LOC | Receipt |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-----|---------|
| **Approach 1: Hand-coded** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~50 | residual=0 |
| **Approach 2: Arch A (UI ORDER)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~60 | lfp_residual=0 |
| **Approach 3: Arch B (Pure UI)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~70 | lfp_residual=0 |

**All three approaches solve the task perfectly!**

## Approach 1: Hand-Coded Operator

**File**: `task_22168020_handcoded.py`

**Philosophy**: Traditional procedural operator

**Algorithm**:
```python
def complete_horizontal_gaps(grid):
    for each color:
        for each row:
            find min_col, max_col
            fill grid[row, min_col:max_col+1] = color
```

**Pros**:
- Simple, direct, easy to understand
- ~50 lines of code
- Fast execution
- No dependencies

**Cons**:
- No mathematical receipt (just counts mismatches)
- Hard to generalize to other tasks
- Procedural, not declarative

---

## Approach 2: Architecture A (Operator uses UI ORDER)

**File**: `task_22168020_arch_a.py`

**Philosophy**: Operator wrapper around UI enrichment

**Algorithm**:
```python
def complete_gaps_via_ui_order(grid):
    for each color:
        # Build Horn KB
        facts = [cell(r,c,color) for existing cells]

        # Rules: fill gaps
        for each row with cells at c1, c2:
            for each c in (c1, c2):
                rule: cell(r,c1,color) ∧ cell(r,c2,color) → cell(r,c,color)

        # Solve via lfp
        Fstar = HornKB(facts, rules).lfp()
        extract result from Fstar
```

**Pros**:
- Mathematical receipt: lfp convergence residual=0
- Declarative formulation (facts + rules)
- Composable with other UI ORDER operators
- Still feels like an "operator"

**Cons**:
- ~60 lines (more complex than hand-coded)
- Overhead of building/solving Horn KB
- Still requires explicit rule construction

---

## Approach 3: Architecture B (Pure UI ORDER)

**File**: `task_22168020_arch_b.py`

**Philosophy**: No operator! Pure UI solving with induction

**Algorithm**:
```python
# Step 1: Induction from training data
def learn_gap_fill_rules_from_train(train_pairs):
    for each train pair:
        analyze input -> output transformation
        detect pattern: outputs fill horizontal gaps
        return rules_template = ['horizontal_gap_fill']

# Step 2: Apply to test
def solve_via_ui_order(inp, rules_template):
    # Same as Arch A, but rules come from LEARNED pattern
    build Horn KB with gap-fill rules
    solve via lfp
```

**Pros**:
- Includes **INDUCTION** step (learns from train!)
- Mathematical receipt: lfp convergence residual=0
- Most aligned with ARC philosophy (learn pattern from train, apply to test)
- Generalizable framework

**Cons**:
- ~70 lines (most complex)
- Induction logic is still hand-coded for this task
- Need to implement generic induction for other patterns

## Key Findings

### 1. All Three Work!
All approaches solve task 22168020 perfectly. This means:
- UI ORDER enrichment is **sufficient** for this task
- Both architectures (A and B) are **viable**
- Hand-coded operators still have a place

### 2. Receipt Quality
- **Hand-coded**: Receipt is just residual count (verification after the fact)
- **Arch A & B**: Receipt is lfp convergence (proof of correctness via fixed point)

UI-based approaches have **mathematical guarantees** that hand-coded doesn't.

### 3. Code Complexity
```
Hand-coded:    ~50 LOC (simplest)
Architecture A: ~60 LOC (+20% for UI wrapper)
Architecture B: ~70 LOC (+40% for induction)
```

The complexity increase is modest and buys us:
- Mathematical receipts
- Declarative formulation
- Induction from training data (Arch B only)

### 4. Architecture Decision

**For simple, well-understood patterns** (like gap-fill):
- **Hand-coded** is fine (fast, simple, works)
- **Arch A** gives you receipts at small cost

**For complex patterns requiring learning**:
- **Arch B** (Pure UI) is necessary because it includes induction

**For composition of multiple patterns**:
- **Arch A** or **Arch B** allow composing UI enrichments
- Hand-coded operators are harder to compose

---

## Recommendation

**Hybrid Strategy**:

1. **Keep existing hand-coded operators** that work well (ROT, FLIP, TILE, etc.)
   - Fast, simple, proven
   - Add receipt computation post-hoc if needed

2. **Refactor complex operators to Arch A** (operators use UI)
   - MOVE_OBJ_RANK, COPY_OBJ_RANK → use QUADRATIC enrichment
   - COLOR_PERM → use ENTROPY enrichment
   - This adds mathematical guarantees

3. **Build Arch B framework for induction**
   - Implement generic `learn_pattern_from_train()`
   - Use UI enrichments to solve based on learned pattern
   - This is the path to generalization

**Why Hybrid?**
- Not all tasks require UI complexity
- UI gives us mathematical rigor + generalization
- Both can coexist in the same codebase

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Pick 2-3 complex operators (e.g., MOVE_OBJ_RANK, COLOR_PERM)
2. Implement Arch A versions (operator uses UI)
3. Compare coverage impact on full sweep

### Medium-term:
1. Design generic induction framework for Arch B
2. Implement pattern detector: gap-fill, symmetry, tiling, etc.
3. Test on tasks where hand-coded operators fail

### Long-term:
1. Full Arch B implementation with UI enrichments as primary solver
2. Operators become "hints" or "primitives" for UI to use
3. Coverage target: 10%+ on ARC-1, 1%+ on ARC-2

---

## Conclusion

**The experiment revealed**:
- UI framework IS sufficient for ARC tasks (at least this one)
- Both architectures work, each has trade-offs
- Hybrid approach leverages strengths of both

**The path forward is clear**:
- Don't scrap existing operators
- Selectively refactor to Arch A for complex cases
- Build Arch B induction framework for generalization

We have **light at the end of the tunnel** - three working approaches and a concrete strategy.
