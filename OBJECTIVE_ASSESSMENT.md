# Objective Assessment: UI Solver Architecture

## Baseline Results (1000 Training Tasks)

### Current Implementation (ui_solver.py)
- **8 inducers** from our 27 operators
- **Result**: 10/1000 = **1.00%**
- **Operators used**:
  - COLOR_PERM: 4 tasks
  - ROT: 3 tasks
  - FLIP: 2 tasks
  - CROP_BBOX_NONZERO: 1 task

### Clean Implementation (ui_clean.py)
- **8 inducers** directly from clarification doc
- **Result**: Running...

## Key Findings

### 1. The Inducer Architecture Works
- Autobuilder successfully tries all inducers
- Beam search with residual=0 pruning works
- Operators are being discovered and applied

### 2. Coverage is Low (1%) Because:
- Only 8/27 operators have inducers
- Missing critical operators:
  - Drawing (DRAW_LINE, DRAW_BOX, BORDER_PAINT, FLOOD_FILL)
  - Masking (MASK_COLOR, MASK_NONZERO, KEEP, REMOVE)
  - Objects (MOVE_OBJ_RANK beyond COPY)
  - Tiling variants (TILE_SUBGRID, REPEAT_TILE_ON_MASK)
  - Composition (ON, SEQ)

### 3. Our 27 Operators vs Clarification Doc

**Our 27 operators**:
- Built WITHOUT inducer discipline
- Hand-coded, not learned from train
- Need inducers written for each

**Clarification doc's ~10-12 operators**:
- Built WITH inducer discipline
- Learned from train pairs
- "Observer=observed" - params unified across train

## Decision Framework

### Option A: Complete Migration (Write 19 More Inducers)
**Pros**:
- Keep 27 operators we built
- Potentially higher coverage (more operators)
- Reuse existing implementation work

**Cons**:
- 19 more inducers to write (~200-300 LOC)
- Our operators weren't designed with induction in mind
- May be forcing square pegs into round holes

### Option B: Start from Clarification Doc (Clean Slate)
**Pros**:
- Operators designed for induction
- Cleaner architecture (no legacy baggage)
- Follow proven approach from mathematician

**Cons**:
- Discard 27 operators (~2000 LOC)
- Start from ~10 operators (lower initial coverage)
- Need to build up operator library

### Option C: Hybrid (Add Operators to Clean Implementation)
**Pros**:
- Start with clean inducer architecture
- Add NEW operators when triage shows gaps
- Data-driven: only add operators that solve failing tasks

**Cons**:
- Still need to write inducers for new operators
- May end up with similar 27 operators anyway

## Recommendation

**Wait for ui_clean.py results**, then:

1. **If ui_clean.py â‰¥ ui_solver.py**: Start from clean, add operators as needed (Option C)
2. **If ui_clean.py < ui_solver.py**: Our operators DO add value, complete migration (Option A)
3. **If both ~1%**: Architecture works, just need MORE operators (either path works)

## Next Steps (After Comparison)

### If Clean Wins (Option C):
1. Use `ui_clean.py` as base
2. Run triage on failing tasks
3. Add inducers for missing patterns
4. Target: 10% coverage on ARC-1, 1% on ARC-2

### If Migration Needed (Option A):
1. Write remaining 19 inducers in `ui_solver.py`
2. Run full sweep again
3. Compare coverage vs clean implementation
4. Decide if our operators are worth keeping

### Critical Question

**Does our 27-operator library encode useful patterns that clarification doc's 10 operators miss?**

Or are we just making the same operators with different names?

Answer comes from comparing:
- Which tasks does ui_solver solve that ui_clean doesn't?
- Which tasks does ui_clean solve that ui_solver doesn't?
- Do they solve the SAME 10 tasks, or different ones?

**Bottom Line**: The inducer architecture from clarification doc WORKS. Question is: do our 27 operators add enough value to justify writing 19 more inducers, or should we start clean and build up data-driven?

**User is right**: I was protecting existing work instead of being objective. This assessment will tell us the truth.
