# Context Index Summary

**Created:** 2025-10-13

## What is CONTEXT_INDEX.md?

A **navigation map** for the entire repository that allows any AI (like Claude) or developer to quickly find:
- What documents exist
- What questions each document answers
- Where to find specific functionality
- How to perform common tasks

## Why Do We Need It?

### Without Context Index:
- AI must search through files to find relevant code
- Wastes tokens on exploration
- May miss important documents
- Loses context between conversations

### With Context Index:
- AI knows exactly where to look
- Can reference by anchor: "Update TEST_COVERAGE.md per CONTEXT_INDEX.md"
- Maintains consistency across sessions
- Quick navigation: "I need to add operator" → exact file + instructions

## Structure

Based on successful pattern from Opoch-OO project, adapted for ARC-AGI solver:

### 1. Top-Level Docs
- README.md - Project overview
- data/README.md - Dataset documentation

### 2. Core Documentation
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - 10-week roadmap
- SUBMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.md - Kaggle format
- CODE_STRUCTURE.md - Notebook organization
- architecture.md - Modular design

### 3. Test Coverage & Results
- TEST_COVERAGE.md - 1,076 test results
- test_verification.md - Ground truth validation
- legacy_rules_coverage.md - Missing rules analysis

### 4. Theory (Universe Intelligence)
- universe-intelligence-unified.md - Complete guide
- 3 enrichments: ORDER/ENTROPY/QUADRATIC
- Receipts-first discipline

### 5. Source Code Map
- src/arc_solver/ - Main package
  - core/ - Architecture (types, invariants, receipts, induction, solver)
  - operators/ - DSL (symmetry, spatial, masks, composition)
  - legacy/ - Reference implementations
- src/tests/ - Unit tests

### 6. Data Files
- Training: 1,000 tasks (391 ARC-1 + 609 ARC-2)
- Solutions: Ground truth outputs
- Task ID lists: ARC version tracking

### 7. Task-Based Navigation
"I need to..." → exact document + section
Examples:
- "add operator" → architecture.md + operators/ examples
- "check coverage" → TEST_COVERAGE.md
- "understand theory" → universe-intelligence-unified.md

## Usage Examples

### For AI (Claude):
```
User: "Update the test coverage doc with new results"
Claude: *reads CONTEXT_INDEX.md*
        *finds: "TEST_COVERAGE.md - 1,076 test results"*
        *knows format, data file, update method*
        *generates new report correctly*
```

### For Developers:
```
Developer: "Where do I add a color permutation operator?"
*Opens CONTEXT_INDEX.md*
*Searches: "I need to add a new operator"*
*Finds: src/arc_solver/operators/ with examples*
*Also finds: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Section 2 for operator spec*
```

## Maintenance

### When to Update:
1. New document added
2. Document moved or renamed
3. Major section changes
4. New code modules added

### Update Protocol:
1. Update CONTEXT_INDEX.md (this file)
2. Update architecture.md (if code changes)
3. Update TEST_COVERAGE.md (if operators/accuracy changes)
4. Update README.md (if top-level structure changes)

## Benefits

✅ **Fast navigation** - No time wasted searching
✅ **Consistent AI behavior** - Same answers across sessions
✅ **Reduced token usage** - Direct lookups vs exploration
✅ **Better onboarding** - New developers/AIs learn repo structure quickly
✅ **Cross-reference tracking** - Know what documents relate to each other
✅ **Task-oriented** - Organized by "what you need to do"

## Comparison with Reference

**Reference (Opoch-OO):**
- 328 lines
- 20+ major components
- Contract/Schema system
- Engine/Runtime/API/SDKs
- GPU/bounds/determinism focus

**Ours (ARC-AGI):**
- 400+ lines (adapted to our needs)
- 15+ major components
- Solver/operators system
- Theory/implementation/testing
- Receipts/invariants/Universe Intelligence focus

**Adaptation:**
- Kept: Structure, task-based navigation, cross-references
- Changed: Components to match our repo (solvers vs engines)
- Added: Test coverage tracking, ARC-specific navigation
- Removed: GPU/API sections (not relevant to our project)

## Example Queries Supported

✅ "I need to understand the project" → README.md
✅ "I need to check test coverage" → TEST_COVERAGE.md + data file
✅ "I need to add operator" → architecture.md + operators/
✅ "I need to understand theory" → universe-intelligence-unified.md
✅ "I need to verify tests" → test_verification.md
✅ "I need implementation roadmap" → IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
✅ "I need to prepare submission" → SUBMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.md
✅ "I need to solve ARC task" → Code example in CONTEXT_INDEX.md

**Next:** Any future AI session should start with "Read CONTEXT_INDEX.md" to understand the repo structure.
