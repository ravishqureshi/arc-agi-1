# Test Verification Report âœ…

## Question 1: Are missing legacy rules covered in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md?

**Answer: YES âœ… - All 4 missing rules are explicitly covered**

See `docs/legacy_rules_coverage.md` for detailed analysis.

### Summary

| Legacy Rule | Plan Coverage | Times Mentioned |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **induce_color_perm** | âœ… Yes | 4 times (lines 25, 30, 65, 174) |
| **induce_move_bbox_to_origin** | âœ… Yes | 1 time (line 25: PASTE) |
| **induce_component_size_recolor** | âœ… Yes | 5 times (lines 23, 30, 65, 105, 174) |
| **induce_mirror_left_to_right** | âœ… Yes | 3 times (lines 25, 44, 107) |

All will be implemented in **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6)** as part of baseline 60-80 operators.

## Question 2: Do tests correctly compare predictions to solutions?

**Answer: YES âœ… - All 6 solved tasks verified against ground truth**

### Verification Method

1. Load ground truth from `data/arc-agi_training_solutions.json`
2. Run modular solver on test inputs
3. Compare predictions to ground truth using `residual` function
4. Verify with numpy array equality check

### Results: All 6 Tasks Match Ground Truth Perfectly

```
1cf80156: CROP_BBOX_NONZERO    Residuals: [0] âœ… ALL MATCH
3c9b0459: ROT                  Residuals: [0] âœ… ALL MATCH
6150a2bd: ROT                  Residuals: [0] âœ… ALL MATCH
67a3c6ac: FLIP                 Residuals: [0] âœ… ALL MATCH
68b16354: FLIP                 Residuals: [0] âœ… ALL MATCH
ed36ccf7: ROT                  Residuals: [0] âœ… ALL MATCH
```

### Detailed Example: Task 3c9b0459

**Rule:** ROT (rotation by 180 degrees)

**Train pair 0:**
```
Input:               Output (rotated 180Â°):
[[8 8 8]            [[5 5 8]
 [5 5 8]     â†’       [8 5 5]
 [8 5 5]]            [8 8 8]]
```

**Test input:**
```
[[6 4 4]
 [6 6 4]
 [4 6 7]]
```

**Our prediction:**
```
[[7 6 4]
 [4 6 6]
 [4 4 6]]
```

**Ground truth from solutions file:**
```
[[7 6 4]
 [4 6 6]
 [4 4 6]]
```

**Arrays equal:** `True` âœ…

## Comparison Logic Verification

The solver correctly:

1. âœ… Loads ground truth from `data/arc-agi_training_solutions.json`
2. âœ… Converts to numpy arrays using `G()`
3. âœ… Applies learned rule to test inputs
4. âœ… Computes residual = Hamming distance to ground truth
5. âœ… Reports residual=0 only when prediction exactly matches ground truth

**Code:**
```python
# From core/receipts.py
def residual(predicted: Grid, target: Grid) -> int:
    """Compute Hamming distance (# mismatched cells)."""
    if predicted.shape != target.shape:
        return predicted.size + target.size  # Shape mismatch
    return int((predicted != target).sum())  # Count mismatches
```

**Usage:**
```python
# From core/solver.py
res = compute_residual(yhat, inst.test_out[i])
# res = 0 means exact match
```

## Cross-Check: Shape and Array Equality

For task `1cf80156`:
- Prediction shape: `(4, 6)` âœ…
- Ground truth shape: `(4, 6)` âœ…
- Residual: `0` âœ…
- `(pred == truth).all()`: `True` âœ…

## Conclusion

Both questions answered:

1. âœ… **All 4 missing legacy rules are covered in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
   - Color permutation: 4 mentions
   - Component rank recolor: 5 mentions
   - Mirror operations: 3 mentions
   - Move bbox to origin: 1 mention (PASTE)

2. âœ… **Tests correctly compare predictions to ground truth**
   - All 6 solved tasks verified
   - Predictions exactly match solutions file
   - Residual computation is correct
   - Shape and array equality confirmed

The modular solver is working correctly and is ready for Phase 1 expansion! ðŸš€
