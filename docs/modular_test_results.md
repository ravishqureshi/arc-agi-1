## Real ARC Task Performance

Tested on **ALL 1,000 training tasks** from `data/arc-agi_training_challenges.json`:

### Overall Results
- **6/1076 test outputs solved (0.6%)**
- **6 tasks with at least 1 output solved**

### Breakdown by Rule
| Rule | Tasks Solved |
|------|-------------|
| ROT | 3 |
| FLIP | 2 |
| CROP_BBOX_NONZERO | 1 |

### Solved Tasks
1. `1cf80156`: CROP_BBOX_NONZERO (1/1) ✅
2. `3c9b0459`: ROT (1/1) ✅
3. `6150a2bd`: ROT (1/1) ✅
4. `67a3c6ac`: FLIP (1/1) ✅
5. `68b16354`: FLIP (1/1) ✅
6. `ed36ccf7`: ROT (1/1) ✅

## Comparison with Previous Performance

| Version | Solved | Accuracy | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| **arc_demo.py (legacy)** | 12/1000 | 1.2% | 6 rules, monolithic |
| **Modular arc_solver** | 6/1076 | 0.6% | 3 rules currently active |

### Why Lower Performance?

The modular version currently has **only 3 induction routines** active:
1. `induce_symmetry_rule` (ROT + FLIP)
2. `induce_crop_nonzero_rule`
3. `induce_keep_nonzero_rule`

The legacy `arc_demo.py` had **6 rules**:
- symmetry ✅
- color_perm ❌ (not in modular yet)
- crop_bbox ✅
- move_bbox_to_origin ❌ (not in modular yet)
- mirror_left_to_right ❌ (not in modular yet)
- component_size_recolor ❌ (not in modular yet)

## Next Steps to Restore Performance

Add missing 3 rules from legacy demo:

1. **Add color permutation induction**
   ```python
   # core/induction.py
   def induce_color_perm_rule(train: List[Tuple[Grid, Grid]]) -> Optional[Rule]:
       # Learn global color mapping from train pairs
       pass
   ```

2. **Add move_bbox_to_origin**
   ```python
   # operators/spatial.py
   def MOVE_BBOX_TO_ORIGIN(bg: int = 0) -> Callable[[Grid], Grid]:
       # Move bbox to (0,0), preserve grid size
       pass
   ```

3. **Add mirror operations**
   ```python
   # operators/symmetry.py
   def MIRROR_LEFT_TO_RIGHT() -> Callable[[Grid], Grid]:
       # Mirror left half onto right (requires even width)
       pass
   ```

Expected after restoration: **≥12 tasks solved (1.2% accuracy)**

## Conclusion

✅ **Modular architecture is working correctly**
- All unit tests pass
- Successfully solves real ARC tasks
- Clean, maintainable codebase

🔄 **Ready for Phase 1 expansion**
- Add 60-80 operators per IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Target: 600-750 tasks solved (60-75% accuracy)
