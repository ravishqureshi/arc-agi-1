Below is the master operator for ARC-AGI, stated purely in math and tied back to our receipts-first discipline. It unifies all the local operators (symmetry, tiling, parity, morphology, copy/move, quadrants, etc.) into one object that—when the catalog of constraints is complete—solves tasks by fixed-point rather than search.

The idea is simple:
	•	Treat the (unknown) output grid for each test case as a set-valued grid (each cell allows a set of colors).
	•	Derive from the train pairs a finite family of closure operators (constraints) that each remove impossible colors or arrangements (never add).
	•	Compose them and iterate to the least fixed point.
	•	If every pixel’s set shrinks to a single color (a singleton), we have a proof-by-fixed-point solution (no guessing; no beam); otherwise the catalog lacks a constraint—add it.

This is exactly “inside settles; edges write” in mathematics: train pairs are the edges that write constraints; the unknown test grid is the inside that settles by a fixed point.

⸻

1) Universe discipline (kept intact)
	•	Inside settles: accept a solution only when the interior reaches a stable fixed point (no more narrowing).
	•	Edges write: only train facts and induced invariants constrain the interior; all edits are logged.
	•	Observer = observed: the same parameterization (anchor, Δ, motif, map) must fit all train pairs.

⸻

2) Domain of discourse: grids as a finite complete lattice

Let C=\{0,\dots,9\} (colors). A grid of size H\times W is a function g:\{1,\dots,H\}\times\{1,\dots,W\}\to C.

For solving a test, we treat the unknown output as a set-valued grid
U:\ \{1,\dots,H\}\times\{1,\dots,W\}\to \mathcal P(C),
ordered pointwise by set inclusion: U\preceq V \iff \forall p,\ U(p)\subseteq V(p).

(\mathcal P(C)^{H\times W}, \preceq) is a finite complete lattice.
Top element \top is “anything allowed” (every cell admits all colors); bottom \bot is “inconsistent”.

⸻

3) From train pairs to closure operators

A closure here is a monotone, idempotent, shrinking map
T_i:\ \mathcal P(C)^{H\times W}\to \mathcal P(C)^{H\times W}
that enforces one invariant deduced from all train pairs.

Each family below yields such a closure; we sketch the law each enforces.

3.1 Color permutation (global map)

Induce \pi\in S_{10} that satisfies y=\pi(x) on every train pair (x,y).
Closure on U: for each pixel p, force U(p)\subseteq \pi(C) and, if \pi is bijective on a used subset, rename admissible colors accordingly. (Monotone/idempotent.)

Law: g=\pi(x)\ \Rightarrow\ \forall p,\ g(p)=\pi(x(p)).

3.2 Symmetry (dihedral/diagonal)

If train enforces y=F(x) with F\in\{\mathrm{ROT}k,\mathrm{FLIP}{h/v},\mathrm{DIAG}\} then for test we must have the same mapping structure. Closure narrows U by requiring the pixelwise relation U(p)\subseteq F\!\cdot\!U(F^{-1}p).

Law: g=F(x)\ \Rightarrow\ \forall p,\ g(p)=F(x)(p)=x(F^{-1}p).

3.3 Parity / general modulo patterns

Induce period (p,q) and anchor (a_r,a_c) from train outputs. Define a periodic mask
M_{p,q,a}(r,c) \equiv ((r-a_r)\bmod p,(c-a_c)\bmod q).
If train shows “on cells in class k, color is d_k (or recolored to constant d)”, then closure restricts U on those congruence classes.

Law: g(p) = f(M_{p,q,a}(p)) for some class function f.

3.4 Tiling / motif (with or without mask)

Induce minimal h,w and motif m\in C^{h\times w} with y=\mathrm{tile}(m) (or tiling applied only on mask M). Closure enforces U pointwise to agree with the tiled motif (either globally or only on mask pixels M derived from x\neq y).

Law: g = \mathrm{tile}(m) (or g=\mathrm{mask\_fill}(m,M)).

3.5 Morphology (hole-fill; open/close/outline)

Induce that each object’s interior holes (background not reachable from bbox border) are filled with its color. Closure converts set holes to singleton color deterministically.

Law: holes = bg \wedge not-reachable; g= fill holes in each bbox.

3.6 Copy/Move/Repeat (object arithmetic)

Induce a template object mask M_X (e.g., smallest per color) and delta set \Delta=\{\delta_1,\dots,\delta_k\} with exact shape-checks:
\mathrm{shift}(M_X,\delta_j) = M_{Y,j}\quad \text{(for each target object in train)}.
Closure for test: for each \delta\in\Delta, pixels in \mathrm{shift}(M_X,\delta) must assume the template color; (for move) template source becomes bg.

Law: g=\mathrm{copy\_by\_deltas}(x;M_X,\Delta) (and analog for move).

3.7 Quadrants (tile/reflect), lines, mask boolean algebra

Similarly, each becomes a closure: they impose exact equalities between sets of pixels (possibly masked).
Examples: quadrant tile: g = \mathrm{tile}(Q_1(x)); reflect-on-mask: g(p)=x(R(p)) for p\in M.

All these T_i are monotone (only remove possibilities), idempotent (applying twice is same), and commute enough for lfp existence (we don’t require full commutation; Tarski suffices).

⸻

4) The Master Operator (definition)

Let \mathcal T=\{T_1,\dots,T_m\} be the closures induced from all train pairs (one parameterization per family, unified across pairs). Define the composite tightening map
F(U) \;=\; (T_m\circ \cdots \circ T_2\circ T_1)(U).
By Tarski’s fixed-point theorem on a complete lattice, F has a least fixed point
U^\star \;=\; \mathrm{lfp}(F) \;=\; \bigwedge \{U\ |\ F(U)\preceq U\}.
	•	Start at U_0=\top (all colors allowed).
	•	Iterate U_{k+1}=F(U_k).
	•	Since the lattice is finite and F is monotone, U_k\downarrow U^\star in finitely many steps.

If U^\star(p)=\{c_p\} (a singleton) for every pixel p, define the solution grid g^\star(p)=c_p. This is your ARC answer—with an intrinsic proof: it is the least fixed point of the jointly induced closures.

If some cell remains multi-valued, the catalog is insufficient (under-constrained): add a missing closure (e.g., diagonal repetition) and rerun. (Observer = observed guides which closure is missing.)

⸻

5) Why this is complete (when the catalog is complete)
	•	Each ARC family we face (symmetry, tiling, parity, morphology, copy/move, quadrants, lines, boolean masks, modulo patterns) can be expressed as equalities the closures enforce.
	•	If the true mapping g lies in the joint fixed-point set of these closures (i.e., our catalog contains the correct laws), then starting from \top the iteration converges to exactly g.
	•	No search is needed; beam search is an engineering approximation to this lfp calculus.

⸻

6) Receipts (what you publish with each solve)
	•	Train residuals: the closures extracted from train must send each train input x to the train output y exactly (verify before solving tests).
	•	Fixed-point certificate: the sequence U_0 \succeq U_1 \succeq \dots \succeq U^\star (finite) and no further change F(U^\star)=U^\star.
	•	Edit bill: count of cells that changed compared to input x (total/boundary/interior).
	•	PCE: the exact equalities invoked (e.g., “copy smallest per color along Δ={…}; tile motif 2×3 on mask; fill holes per object; reflect on diagonal”).

If any equality fails on train, you reject the closure (no “approximate fits”); if the lfp leaves a multi-valued cell, you explicitly state “under-constrained; add closure X” (from mask analysis).

⸻

7) Relation to our current system
	•	The beam composer you built is a practical way to discover a small set of closures whose joint fixed point equals the output.
	•	The master operator above is the mathematical object behind that process: one operator F whose least fixed point directly is the solution.

⸻

8) Minimal pseudocode (just to see the mechanics)

# Set-valued grid lattice
TOP = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
U = [[set(TOP) for _ in range(W)] for _ in range(H)]

# Build closures T_i from train pairs (each T returns a narrowed U)
closures = []
if color_perm_pi_is_unified(train): closures.append(T_color_perm(pi))
if symmetry_F_is_unified(train):    closures.append(T_symmetry(F))
if parity_is_unified(train):        closures.append(T_parity(parity, anchor, color_or_map))
if tiling_is_unified(train):        closures.append(T_tile(motif))
if tiling_on_mask_is_unified(train):closures.append(T_tile_on_mask(motif, M_xy))
if holefill_is_unified(train):      closures.append(T_holefill())
if copy_by_deltas_is_unified(train):closures.append(T_copy_by_deltas(M_template, Delta))
# ... add any other unified closures (quadrants, modulo, boolean masks, lines, etc.)

def F(U):
    for T in closures:
        U = T(U)   # each T is monotone & shrinking
    return U

# Iterate to least fixed point
while True:
    U_next = F(U)
    if U_next == U: break
    U = U_next

# If every U[p] is singleton -> solution; else under-constrained (add closure)
if all(len(U[r][c])==1 for r in range(H) for c in range(W)):
    g_star = [[next(iter(U[r][c])) for c in range(W)] for r in range(H)]
    # receipts: bill, boundary/interior counts, closure list (PCE)
else:
    # identify which closure is missing by inspecting remaining ambiguities
    # (e.g., diagonal repetition, quadrant mask...)
    pass

This pseudocode is not a new solver; it shows how the solver you have is computing (or approximating) the same fixed point. In practice you apply the closures deterministically in a canonical order (or until no change) and log the narrowing sequence as receipts.

⸻

9) What to add (if you want lfp to reach 100%)

This is exactly the “missing operators” list we curating already:
	•	Mask Boolean algebra (AND/OR/XOR/NOT), so constraints combine precisely.
	•	Full morphology (open/close/outline), beyond hole-fill.
	•	General modulo patterns (period p\times q) and diagonal repetition.
	•	Quadrant/reflect-on-mask, negative-space stencils, adjacency recolors.

Each becomes one more closure T_i: monotone, idempotent, shrinking—and once it’s unified on train, the lfp includes that information and collapses the unknown to a unique solution.

⸻

One line to carry

The master operator for ARC is the least fixed point of the jointly induced, receipts-sound closure operators from the train pairs. When the catalog of closures is complete, the lfp grid is the solution—no guessing, only math: inside settles; edges write.
---
Absolutely—moving to the fixed-point “master operator” view really does make things easier in the ways that matter: it turns ARC from “search for a program” into “prove a grid by narrowing it until nothing else can be true.” Here’s the full picture—why it helps, and why we didn’t do it earlier.

⸻

Why the fixed-point approach is easier (and better)

1) One mental model, not a zoo of tricks
Instead of juggling dozens of ad-hoc operators and beam states, you keep one object:
	•	a set-valued grid (each cell: allowable colors), and
	•	a small family of closures T_i induced from train that only remove impossibilities.

You then iterate: U \leftarrow T_m\cdots T_1(U) until it stops changing. That’s it.

2) Determinism and proofs by construction
	•	Monotone closures on a finite lattice must converge to a least fixed point.
	•	If every cell becomes a singleton, you have a proof the solution is necessary (no guessing).
	•	Train acceptance is binary: closures either map every train input exactly to its output or they are rejected.

3) Composability without search explosion
Closures compose; each narrows the same U. You don’t pay combinatorial beams—most tasks collapse in a handful of passes.

4) Perfect triage
If a cell remains multi-valued at the fixed point, you learn exactly what’s missing (e.g., a diagonal modulo constraint on a residual mask). Add one closure; rerun. No “mystery bugs.”

5) Stable tie-breaks and auditability
You can log the narrowing sequence \(U_0 \succeq U_1 \succeq \dots \succeq U^\*\) (receipts), plus the exact equalities each closure enforces (PCE). Investors and reviewers get a crisp, checkable story.

⸻

So why didn’t we apply it earlier?

A) We were still filling the catalog
The master operator works when you have enough closures (laws) to pin outputs. Early on we lacked:
	•	modulo patterns beyond parity,
	•	diagonal repetition, quadrant-on-mask,
	•	full morphology (open/close/outline),
	•	boolean mask algebra,
	•	robust shape-checked copy/move/chain.

Without these, a fixed-point run often stopped with multi-valued cells—so we leaned on beam search to find useful compositions while we learned which laws were missing.

B) We optimized for engineering leverage first
Beam + parametric inducers is a pragmatic discovery tool:
	•	It reveals residual patterns that point to the next operator to add.
	•	It’s easier to prototype and validate families one by one before formalizing them as closures.

C) Fear of “set-valued” complexity
A lattice of 10^{H\cdot W} possibilities sounds scary—until you remember we never enumerate; closures prune pointwise and converge quickly in practice. It took time to see that the math is simple and fast enough.

D) Unification across train pairs wasn’t automated
Observer = observed (same parameters for all train pairs) is the key. We had to build solid unifiers (for anchors, \Delta sets, motifs) with shape checks (shifted masks equal), not just centroids. That maturity came with the receipts discipline.

E) Tooling & discipline weren’t strict yet
The master view demands three hard gates we later standardized:
	•	Train residual = 0 only,
	•	No partial step may increase residual,
	•	Exact parameter unification—or explicit contradiction receipts.
Until those were cultural defaults, fixed-point would have been noisy.

⸻

What changes now (practically)

1) Flip the solver’s control flow
	•	Before: search for a short program; verify.
	•	Now: induce closures; iterate to lfp; only if under-constrained, drop into targeted operator discovery.

2) Keep beam as a discovery tool
Use beam on the residual masks of an under-constrained fixed-point to propose the single closure that will collapse the remainder. Then promote it to a true T_i.

3) Make receipts stricter and smaller
	•	Log \langle U_k \to U_{k+1}\rangle deltas (which pixels shrank) per closure.
	•	Store just the final lfp, closure list, and a compact proof (train: exact mapping; test: all singletons).
	•	Determinism is natural here—closures are pure; order only affects how fast, not the fixed-point.

⸻

What to add (the last pieces)

To get to 100%, finish the closure catalog (each with a precise law, unifier, and shape check):
	•	Mask Boolean algebra: AND/OR/XOR/NOT—lets closures target exactly the residual set M=(x\neq y) and its transforms.
	•	Full morphology: OPEN, CLOSE, OUTLINE.
	•	General modulo (p,q) with anchors (not just parity).
	•	Diagonal repetition and quadrant-on-mask (copy/reflect/tile only on M).
	•	Negative-space stencils, adjacency recolors (touching rules).
	•	Object arithmetic already added: copy-by-deltas, equalize counts, match global k.

Each is a monotone, shrinking T_i with a law like “g = \mathrm{tile}(m) on mask M” or “shift(template,\Delta) equals target mask”.

⸻

Short migration runbook
	1.	Implement U and closure runner (the lfp engine) alongside your current solver.
	2.	Wrap existing inducers as closures T_i (they already verify train equality).
	3.	Run fixed-point first; if singletons everywhere, you’re done.
	4.	If not, hand the residual mask to your Operator Discovery Coach; add one closure; re-run.
	5.	Freeze beam to a small width as a “suggestion” layer only when needed.

⸻

The bottom line

Yes—this makes it easier and stronger:
	•	One math object ⇒ less code & fewer edge cases.
	•	Proof-by-fixed-point ⇒ no hallucinations or brittle guesses.
	•	Perfect triage ⇒ every failure says exactly which law to add.

We didn’t start here because we were still learning and formalizing the laws. Now that the catalog is rich and the receipts culture is strict, the fixed-point master operator is the natural home. It aligns perfectly with our principle:

Inside settles; edges write. The least fixed point of induced closures is the solution.
