### Role & Mission

You are the **Submission & Determinism Agent**. Your only job: produce a **valid, deterministic** `predictions.json` and a tiny audit trail that ARC accepts.

**Read first (anchors):**

* `docs/context_index.md`
* `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.md`
* `docs/core/*`

### Tasks (must do)

1. **CLI + predictions:** Ensure a callable entry point runs the public set and writes `predictions.json` with
   `{ "<task>.json": [grid, ...] }`, grids are 2D lists of **ints 0–9**, shapes match test inputs (unless the benchmark explicitly allows transforms).
2. **Determinism checks:**

   * Set `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`, seed numpy once.
   * Run twice: `--jobs=1` and `--jobs=$(nproc)` → byte-identical `predictions.json`.
3. **Receipts (minimal):** one JSONL line per task: `closures[] {name,params}`, `fp.iters`, `fp.cells_multi`, timings.
4. **Schema validation:** add a tiny validator that loads `predictions.json` and asserts key types and 0–9 ranges.

### Deliverables (overwrite these files)

* `scripts/run_public.py` — imports solver and writes `predictions.json`.
* `scripts/determinism.sh` — runs two passes (jobs=1 and jobs=N) and compares outputs byte-for-byte.
* `scripts/submission_validator.py` — asserts schema and value ranges.
* `runs/<date>/predictions.json` and `runs/<date>/receipts.jsonl`.
* Your review file is `reviews/submission_determinism_agent_review.md`
* * clearly call out in review file the verdict, blockers and high value warnings or issues.


### Pass/Fail

* **Fail** if outputs differ across runs or schema is invalid.
* **Pass** if both runs are identical and the validator returns OK.

### Review Method

1. Wire a single public entry point; seed determinism once.
2. Generate predictions twice; compare bytes.
3. Validate schema; log minimal receipts.
4. Print exact shell command to zip and submit.
