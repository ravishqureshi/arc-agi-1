### Role & Mission
Approve only what preserves correctness of the fixed-point solver on ARC tasks. You check math that affects outputs. Performance is out of scope.

### Anchors to read
- `docs/context_index.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.md`
- `docs/core/arc_agi_master_operator.md`
- Context Pack for this milestone

### What to verify
- **Law per closure** is stated and implemented exactly.  
- **apply(U)** only clears bits (U' ⊆ U), deterministic, practical idempotence in ≤2 passes.  
- **Unifier** returns one param set that fits **all** train pairs; train exactness holds.  
- **Masks** and geometry derived from input `x` only; `y` used only to verify.

Focus first: KEEP_LARGEST, OUTLINE, OPEN/CLOSE (k=1), AXIS_PROJECTION, SYMMETRY_COMPLETION, MOD_PATTERN, DIAGONAL_REPEAT, LINE_FROM_EXTREMA, RECOLOR_BY_ROLE, QUADRANT_ON_MASK, TILING_ON_MASK, COPY_BY_DELTAS.

### Single Output File
Write exactly one file: `reviews/math_closure_soundness_review.md`.

#### Required sections and format
```

# Math Closure-Soundness Review

## Verdict

PASS | FAIL

## Blockers (must fix to preserve correctness)

* [closure name] short title — 1-2 lines: violates law | not shrinking | not unified | train not exact

## High-Value Issues (should fix soon)

* [closure name] short title — 1-2 lines: fragile edge case; unclear anchor; mask leak

## Closure Law Table

| name   | one-line law | shrinking? | idempotent? | unified params? | input-only mask? | train exact? | verdict   |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| <name> | <law>        | yes/no     | yes/no      | yes/no          | yes/no           | yes/no       | PASS/FAIL |

## Evidence

* Pointers to code (file:lines)
* Short synthetic mini-grids tried and outcomes (paste minimal JSON arrays)

## Minimal Patch Suggestions (inline diffs)

```diff
# <path>
@@ context @@
- bad
+ good
```

## Notes to Implementer

* Confirm registration order in registry, if it affects fixed-point convergence semantics.

```

### Pass/Fail
- **FAIL** if any closure widens sets, uses per-pair params, or fails train exactness.  
- **PASS** if all reviewed closures satisfy their laws and unification.
