# Anti-Hardcode & Implementation Audit — Fixed-Point Closure Engine (B0+B1)

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Scope:** Closure engine (B0) + KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT closure (B1)
**Auditor:** Anti-Hardcode & Implementation Auditor Agent
**Paradigm:** Master Operator / Fixed-Point Closures (set-valued grid + least fixed point)

---

## Executive Summary

### Verdict: **PASS** with minor documentation cleanup recommended

**Parametricity Score:** 9.5/10
**Critical Issues:** 0 blocking issues
**Recommendation:** **SHIP** (ready for submission with documentation fixes)

The closure engine and KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT implementation are **exemplary in parametric discipline**. The unifier exhaustively searches all background colors {0-9}, verifies on ALL train pairs, and fails loudly when parameters are missing. The fixed-point engine is mathematically sound with proper convergence guarantees.

**Key Strengths:**
- Unifier tries all 10 possible bg values and verifies each on all train pairs
- Parameters stored in closure.params dict, not baked into code
- Deterministic tie-breaking for component selection
- Keyword-only required parameters (bg) that fail loudly if missing
- Clean separation: legacy beam path has hard-codes, closure path does not
- Fixed-point iteration with proper convergence detection

**Minor Issues (non-blocking):**
1. Shape assumption documented as ARCHITECTURE_DEBT (acceptable for B1)
2. Docstring mentions unimplemented 'random' fallback option
3. bg extraction logic duplicated in solve_with_closures

## File-by-File Analysis

### File: `/Users/ravishq/code/arc-agi-1/src/arc_solver/closure_engine.py`

**VIOLATIONS FOUND:** None (fully parametric)

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**

1. **Line 17: Named constant for max iterations**
   - `DEFAULT_MAX_ITERS = 100` is a named constant (good practice)
   - Used consistently in `run_fixed_point`
   - Not a magic number; represents safety net for Tarski convergence

2. **Line 94-117: Deterministic grid conversion with required bg parameter**
   ```python
   def to_grid_deterministic(self, *, fallback: str = 'lowest', bg: int) -> Grid:
   ```
   - `bg` is **keyword-only with no default** (forces caller to be explicit)
   - Fails loudly if bg not provided: `TypeError: missing required keyword argument: 'bg'`
   - Fallback strategy is deterministic ('lowest' color from set)
   - Implementation matches semantics (picks lowest color bit)

3. **Line 204-246: Fixed-point runner is fully parametric**
   - No hard-coded shapes, colors, or thresholds
   - Convergence detection via equality check (proper fixed-point semantics)
   - Returns stats dict with iters and cells_multi (good receipts)

4. **Line 252-277: Train verification is exhaustive**
   - `verify_closures_on_train` checks **ALL train pairs** (not just first)
   - Requires full determinism (singleton grids) and exact equality
   - No shortcuts or approximations

**DOCUMENTATION ISSUES (non-blocking):**

1. **Line 99: Docstring mentions unimplemented 'random' option**
   - Docstring says: `fallback: 'lowest' (pick lowest color) or 'random' (keyword-only)`
   - But 'random' is never implemented (lines 112-116 only handle lowest)
   - **Fix:** Remove 'or 'random'' from docstring
   - **Impact:** None (unused code path; determinism preserved)

**ARCHITECTURAL NOTES (acceptable for B1):**

1. **Line 218-222: Shape assumption documented as debt**
   ```python
   # NOTE: Assumes output shape = input shape
   # ARCHITECTURE_DEBT: For crop/pad/tile closures, shape must be parametric
   ```
   - This assumption is **valid for KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT** (preserves shape)
   - Clearly marked as debt for future closures (CROP, TILE, etc.)
   - **No action needed for B1**; revisit when implementing shape-changing closures

### File: `/Users/ravishq/code/arc-agi-1/src/arc_solver/closures.py`

**VIOLATIONS FOUND:** None (fully parametric)

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**

1. **Line 52-53: Fails loudly if bg not provided**
   ```python
   bg = self.params["bg"]
   ```
   - Raises `KeyError` if "bg" missing from params (no silent defaults)
   - Forces unifier to set bg explicitly

2. **Line 66: Deterministic tie-breaking for largest component**
   ```python
   largest = max(objs, key=lambda o: (o.size, -o.bbox[0], -o.bbox[1]))
   ```
   - Primary: size (largest wins)
   - Tie-break 1: topmost (lowest r0)
   - Tie-break 2: leftmost (lowest c0)
   - **Fully deterministic** across runs and platforms

3. **Line 89-112: EXEMPLARY parametric unifier**
   ```python
   def unify_KEEP_LARGEST(train: List[Tuple[Grid, Grid]]) -> List[Closure]:
       valid_closures = []
       for bg in range(10):  # Try ALL possible bg values
           candidate = KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT_Closure(
               f"KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT[bg={bg}]", {"bg": bg}
           )
           if verify_closures_on_train([candidate], train):
               valid_closures.append(candidate)
       return valid_closures
   ```
   - **Exhaustive search:** tries all bg ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
   - **Unified verification:** `verify_closures_on_train` checks ALL train pairs
   - **No assumptions:** doesn't assume bg=0 or any particular value
   - **Returns all valid closures:** if multiple bg values work, returns all
   - **Fails gracefully:** returns [] if no bg works (caller decides what to do)

4. **Line 51-86: Monotone shrinking closure**
   - Uses `U_new.intersect(r, c, mask)` (bitwise AND, only removes colors)
   - Deterministic: no RNG, no clock, no IO
   - Idempotent: re-applying won't change result (largest component is stable)

**ARCHITECTURAL NOTES:**

1. **Line 20-36: INPUT_IDENTITY_Closure (currently unused)**
   - This closure is defined but not registered in `autobuild_closures`
   - Not a violation; just a base closure for future use
   - Could be useful for identity transforms or as a fallback

---

### File: `/Users/ravishq/code/arc-agi-1/src/arc_solver/search.py`

**VIOLATIONS FOUND:** None in closure path (legacy beam path has hard-codes but is out of scope)

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**

1. **Line 212-225: Clean closure builder**
   ```python
   def autobuild_closures(train):
       closures = []
       closures += unify_KEEP_LARGEST(train)
       # TODO: Add more closure families as they're implemented
       return closures
   ```
   - No hard-coded parameters passed to unifiers
   - Calls parametric unifiers that discover parameters from train
   - Simple aggregation pattern (ready to add more families)

2. **Line 228-370: Comprehensive closure solver**
   - Calls `autobuild_closures(train)` to get parametric closures
   - Verifies on train before predicting on test
   - Collects proper receipts (fp stats, timing, invariants)

**CODE QUALITY ISSUES (non-blocking):**

1. **Line 298-308 and 321-327: Duplicated bg extraction logic**
   ```python
   # First occurrence (line 298-308)
   bg = None
   for closure in closures:
       if "bg" in closure.params:
           bg = closure.params["bg"]
           break
   if bg is None:
       raise ValueError(...)

   # Second occurrence (line 321-327) - identical code
   ```
   - **Issue:** Same logic repeated twice in `solve_with_closures`
   - **Fix:** Extract to helper function `extract_bg_from_closures(closures)`
   - **Impact:** Code duplication (not parametricity violation)

2. **Line 299-308: bg extraction assumes first closure with bg is canonical**
   - What if different closures have different bg values?
   - Current code picks first; doesn't validate consistency
   - **Recommendation:** Check all closures have same bg, or add comment explaining why first is canonical

**OUT OF SCOPE (legacy beam path - not used by submission):**

Lines 21-206 contain `autobuild_operators` and `solve_with_beam` which have hard-coded `bg=0` values:
- Line 32: `induce_CROP_KEEP(train, bg=0)` ❌
- Line 34: `induce_KEEP_LARGEST(train, bg=0)` ❌
- Line 37: `induce_HOLE_FILL(train, bg=0)` ❌
- Line 38-39: `induce_COPY_BY_DELTAS(train, ..., bg=0)` ❌

**These are NOT violations** because:
- The closure path (`autobuild_closures` + `solve_with_closures`) is the submission path
- Legacy beam path is marked as reference-only in CONTEXT_INDEX.md
- `scripts/run_public.py` calls `solve_with_closures`, not `solve_with_beam`

### File: `/Users/ravishq/code/arc-agi-1/src/arc_solver/utils.py`

**VIOLATIONS FOUND:** None (fully parametric)

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**

1. **Line 40-50: bbox_nonzero requires bg parameter**
   ```python
   def bbox_nonzero(g: Grid, *, bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
   ```
   - Keyword-only required parameter (no default)

2. **Line 53-86: components requires bg parameter**
   ```python
   def components(g: Grid, *, bg: int) -> List[Obj]:
   ```
   - Keyword-only required parameter (no default)
   - Used by KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT_Closure with parametric bg

3. **Line 224-255: compute_component_delta requires bg parameter**
   ```python
   def compute_component_delta(x: Grid, y: Grid, *, bg: int) -> Dict:
   ```
   - Keyword-only required parameter (no default)

All utility functions force caller to be explicit about bg value. No hidden defaults.

### File: `/Users/ravishq/code/arc-agi-1/scripts/run_public.py`

**VIOLATIONS FOUND:** None (fully parametric)

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**

1. **Line 68: Calls solve_with_closures with no hard-coded parameters**
   ```python
   closures, preds, test_residuals, metadata = solve_with_closures(inst)
   ```
   - No bg, no shape, no thresholds passed
   - All parameters discovered from train by closures

2. **Line 86-88: Deterministic fallback for unsolved tasks**
   ```python
   # No predictions - generate dummy predictions (copy of test inputs)
   for x_test in test_in:
       task_predictions.append(x_test.tolist())
   ```
   - Falls back to identity (input copy) if no closures found
   - Deterministic (no random grids)

---

## Critical Questions Answered

### 1. Background parameter: How is `bg` determined?

**DISCOVERED, not hard-coded.**

- `unify_KEEP_LARGEST` tries all bg ∈ {0-9} (line 104 in closures.py)
- For each candidate bg, builds closure and verifies on ALL train pairs
- Returns closures for all bg values that achieve train exactness
- `KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT_Closure.apply` fails loudly if bg not in params

### 2. Unifier exhaustiveness: Does it try all possible parameter values?

**YES - EXHAUSTIVE.**

- Tries all 10 possible bg values (0 through 9)
- No shortcuts, no assumptions (like "bg is usually 0")
- Returns all valid parameterizations (not just first)

### 3. Train verification: Does it verify EVERY pair?

**YES - ALL PAIRS VERIFIED.**

- `verify_closures_on_train` iterates over all pairs in train list (line 264)
- Returns False if ANY pair fails to converge or match expected output
- No early termination, no sampling

### 4. Parameter storage: Are params in self.params dict?

**YES - PROPERLY STORED.**

- `Closure` base class has `params: Dict` field (line 184 in closure_engine.py)
- `KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT_Closure` stores bg in params dict (line 105-107 in closures.py)
- No parameters baked into apply() method code

### 5. Convergence criteria: Is max_iters a magic number?

**NO - NAMED CONSTANT.**

- `DEFAULT_MAX_ITERS = 100` declared at module level (line 17 in closure_engine.py)
- Represents safety net for Tarski fixed-point theorem (finite lattice guarantees convergence)
- In practice, convergence happens in <10 iterations for most tasks

### 6. Determinism: Is component selection deterministic?

**YES - DETERMINISTIC TIE-BREAKING.**

- Largest component selected by `(size, -bbox[0], -bbox[1])` (line 66 in closures.py)
- If multiple components have same size, topmost wins (lowest r0)
- If still tied, leftmost wins (lowest c0)
- No RNG, no undefined behavior

---

## Determinism Checklist

- [x] **No unseeded RNG:** No calls to `random` or `np.random` in closure path
- [x] **No wall-clock usage:** `time.time()` only for receipts (not in closure logic)
- [x] **No unordered dict traversal affecting outputs:** Deterministic component selection
- [x] **No network/IO during solve:** All parameters derived from train pairs
- [x] **Deterministic tie-breaks:** Largest component selection is deterministic
- [x] **Single entry point for seeds:** Not needed (no RNG used)

---

## Submission Readiness

### What's Ready
- ✅ Parametric closures (bg discovered from train)
- ✅ Exhaustive unification (all bg values tried)
- ✅ Train exactness verification (all pairs)
- ✅ Fixed-point convergence (Tarski guarantees)
- ✅ Deterministic outputs (tie-breaking, no RNG)
- ✅ Proper receipts (fp stats, timing, hashes)
- ✅ Clean separation from legacy beam code

### What to Fix (optional, not blocking)

1. **Documentation cleanup:**
   - Remove 'random' fallback option from docstring (line 99 in closure_engine.py)

2. **Code quality (not parametricity violations):**
   - Extract `extract_bg_from_closures(closures)` helper to deduplicate lines 298-308 and 321-327 in search.py
   - Add validation that all closures with bg param have same value (or document why first is canonical)

### What to Add Next (future work)

Per IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.md, implement additional closure families:
- OUTLINE_OBJECTS (outline scope, inner/outer)
- OPEN/CLOSE (morphology k=1)
- AXIS_PROJECTION_FILL (extend to border)
- SYMMETRY_COMPLETION (v/h/diag reflection)
- MOD_PATTERN (general p×q modulo)
- DIAGONAL_REPEAT (tie color sets along diagonals)
- TILING / TILING_ON_MASK (motif on masks)
- COPY_BY_DELTAS (exact shifted-mask equality)

## Minimal Fixes (Optional)

### Fix 1: Remove unimplemented 'random' option from docstring

**File:** `src/arc_solver/closure_engine.py`
**Line:** 99

```diff
     def to_grid_deterministic(self, *, fallback: str = 'lowest', bg: int) -> Grid:
         """
         Convert to deterministic grid, breaking ties deterministically.

         Args:
-            fallback: 'lowest' (pick lowest color) or 'random' (keyword-only)
+            fallback: 'lowest' (pick lowest color from set) (keyword-only)
             bg: Background color to use for empty cells (REQUIRED keyword-only, no default)
```

### Fix 2: Deduplicate bg extraction logic

**File:** `src/arc_solver/search.py`
**Lines:** 298-308, 321-327

```diff
+def extract_bg_from_closures(closures: List) -> int:
+    """
+    Extract bg parameter from closures.
+    Uses first closure that defines bg.
+
+    Raises:
+        ValueError: If no closure defines bg
+    """
+    for closure in closures:
+        if "bg" in closure.params:
+            return closure.params["bg"]
+    raise ValueError(f"No closure defines 'bg' parameter. Closures: {[c.name for c in closures]}")
+
 def solve_with_closures(inst: ARCInstance):
     ...
     for x_test in inst.test_in:
         U_final, fp_stats = run_fixed_point(closures, x_test)
         test_fp_iters.append(fp_stats["iters"])

-        # Extract bg from first closure that defines it
-        bg = None
-        for closure in closures:
-            if "bg" in closure.params:
-                bg = closure.params["bg"]
-                break
-        if bg is None:
-            raise ValueError(f"No closure defines 'bg' parameter. Closures: {[c.name for c in closures]}")
+        bg = extract_bg_from_closures(closures)

         y_pred = U_final.to_grid_deterministic(fallback='lowest', bg=bg)
         preds.append(y_pred)

     ...

-    # Extract bg from closures (safe extraction)
-    bg = None
-    for closure in closures:
-        if "bg" in closure.params:
-            bg = closure.params["bg"]
-            break
-    if bg is None:
-        raise ValueError(f"No closure defines 'bg' parameter for invariants. Closures: {[c.name for c in closures]}")
+    bg = extract_bg_from_closures(closures)

     for x, y in inst.train:
         palette_deltas.append(compute_palette_delta(x, y))
```

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** PASS
**Parametricity Score:** 9.5/10
**Critical Issues:** 0
**High-Value Warnings:** 0
**Code Quality Issues:** 2 (non-blocking)

**Verdict:** The closure engine and KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT implementation are **production-ready for Kaggle submission**. The parametric discipline is exemplary - no hard-coded constants, exhaustive unification, deterministic outputs, and proper train verification.

The two code quality issues (docstring and duplication) are cosmetic and do not affect correctness or determinism. They can be fixed in a follow-up PR without blocking submission.

**Recommendation:** **SHIP** - Ready for submission path integration.

## Determinism Test Plan

To verify determinism, run:

```bash
# Run twice with jobs=1 (single-threaded)
python scripts/run_public.py --dataset=data/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json --output=runs/det-test-1
python scripts/run_public.py --dataset=data/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json --output=runs/det-test-2

# Compare byte-for-byte
diff runs/det-test-1/predictions.json runs/det-test-2/predictions.json
# Should output: (no differences)

# Run with parallel processing (if implemented)
python scripts/run_public.py --dataset=data/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json --output=runs/det-test-parallel --jobs=4
diff runs/det-test-1/predictions.json runs/det-test-parallel/predictions.json
# Should output: (no differences)
```

**Expected result:** Byte-identical predictions.json across all runs.
