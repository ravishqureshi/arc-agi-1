## Quick Verdict

Your fixed-point closure engine (B0) and first closure (B1: KEEP_LARGEST_COMPONENT) are **mathematically sound and implementation-correct**. No bugs found.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with B2+ closure families with confidence.

## Review Deliverables

### 1. Main Review Document
**File**: `/reviews/MATHEMATICAL_SOUNDNESS_REVIEW.md` (28KB, ~600 lines)

**Contents**:
- Executive summary (all 6 properties VERIFIED)
- Detailed property verification with code evidence
- Edge case analysis
- Comparison with mathematical specification
- Recommendations for minor improvements
- Test coverage suggestions

**Key findings**:
- ✓ Monotonicity: Masks from input only, bitwise AND is monotone
- ✓ Shrinking: Only intersect operations, never adds bits
- ✓ Idempotence: Deterministic masks + AND idempotence
- ✓ Unified params: Single closure, ALL pairs tested
- ✓ Train exactness: Singletons + exact equality on ALL pairs
- ✓ Convergence: True equality check, max_iters safety

### 2. Closure Law Checklist
**File**: `/reviews/CLOSURES_LAW_CHECKLIST.md` (5KB, ~150 lines)

**Contents**:
- One-line law for each closure
- Property verification table (monotone, shrinking, idempotent, etc.)
- Edge cases examined
- Templates for future closures (OUTLINE, SYMMETRY, TILING_ON_MASK)
- Review checklist for new closures (10-point verification)
- Pass/fail criteria

**Use case**: Copy this template for each new closure family you add.

### 3. Minimal Property Tests
**File**: `/tests/test_closures_minimal.py` (12KB, ~430 lines)

**Contents**:
- 13 decisive micro-tests (all passing ✓)
- Tests for all 5 mathematical properties
- Edge case tests (empty grid, single component, equal-size)
- Integration test
- Helper functions for grid comparison

**Test results**: 13/13 passed in <50ms

**Run tests**:
```bash
python tests/test_closures_minimal.py
```

## What Each Property Means (Intuitive)

### 1. Monotonicity: "Looser input → looser output"
If U has fewer restrictions than V, then F(U) has fewer restrictions than F(V).
- Ensures composition works correctly
- Prevents "information leakage" between closures

### 2. Shrinking: "Never add possibilities"
Applying a closure can only restrict, never expand.
- Ensures convergence (finite lattice + monotone shrinking → fixed point)
- Critical for Tarski theorem

### 3. Idempotence: "Applying twice = applying once"
F(F(U)) = F(U)
- Ensures stable fixed point
- Allows any closure order (for independent closures)

### 4. Unified Parameters: "One param set for ALL train pairs"
Same `{bg}` works on every train pair.
- Enforces "observer = observed" principle
- Prevents overfitting to individual pairs

### 5. Train Exactness: "Zero residual, no exceptions"
Fixed point must be all singletons, matching expected output exactly.
- No approximate equality
- No partial solutions
- ALL pairs must pass

### 6. Convergence: "Finite steps to stable state"
Iteration detects U_n = U_{n-1} and stops.
- True equality check (not approximate)
- Safety bound (max_iters=100) never reached in practice

## Code Quality Observations

### Strengths
1. **Clean abstraction**: Lattice ops, closure interface, fixed-point logic all separate
2. **Efficient**: 10-bit masks in uint16, fast bitwise ops
3. **Strong verification**: `verify_closures_on_train()` enforces all gates
4. **Extensible**: Adding new closures is straightforward
5. **Receipts-ready**: Stats include iteration count, multi-valued cells

### Minor Recommendations
1. Add warning if max_iters reached (indicates non-convergence)
2. Document closure application order (affects speed, not correctness)
3. Consider adding `strict` mode to `run_fixed_point()` that raises on non-convergence

None of these affect mathematical correctness.

## Test Coverage

### Current Status
- **Property tests**: 13/13 passing ✓
- **Edge cases**: 3 tested (empty, single, equal-size)
- **Integration**: All properties together ✓

### Recommended Additions (Optional)
1. **Fuzz tests**: Random grids, verify properties hold
2. **Performance**: Measure iterations/time for various grid sizes
3. **Composition**: Multiple closures in sequence

Not critical - current tests are sufficient for soundness verification.

## Migration Path to B2+

### Template for New Closures

1. **State the law** (one line of executable math):
   ```
   ∀(r,c): g(r,c) = <exact formula>
   ```

2. **Implement `apply()`**:
   - Compute masks from `x_input` and `params` ONLY (not U or y)
   - Use only `intersect()` operations (shrinking)
   - Ensure deterministic behavior

3. **Write unifier**:
   - Try ONE param set on ALL train pairs
   - Call `verify_closures_on_train()`
   - Return [] if ANY pair fails

4. **Add to checklist**:
   - Copy template from `CLOSURES_LAW_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Verify all 6 properties
   - Test edge cases

5. **Write minimal tests**:
   - Copy pattern from `test_closures_minimal.py`
   - 2-3 grids per family
   - Test monotone, shrinking, idempotent

### Next Closures to Implement (Priority Order)

Based on `arc_agi_master_operator.md`:

1. **OUTLINE** (morphology): Keep boundary pixels of objects
2. **SYMMETRY_COMPLETION**: Reflect/rotate to complete symmetric patterns
3. **TILING_ON_MASK**: Tile motif only on mask M = (x ≠ y)
4. **OPEN/CLOSE** (morphology): Erosion + dilation
5. **MOD_PATTERN**: General (p,q) modulo with anchor

Each follows the same discipline: exact law, monotone, shrinking, idempotent, unified params.
